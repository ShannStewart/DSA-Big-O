1.1: The big O would be Linerar. Each persona is a string representing the breed of thier dog. For each person the breeds will be compared with the golden retriever to see if they match.

1.2: Logarithmic. The inputs can increase with more inputs but can also be cut short if the value is hit quickly enough.

2: Constant. Only one value is going to be calculated as long as the value is valid. 

3: Polynomial. The algorithm involves multiple loops that will slowly increase depending on the size of the arrays.

4: Linear. One input equals one value that will be acquired.

5: Linear. Each object will go through a loop once.

6: Polynomial. There is a loop in a loop.

7: Linear. Each input is one calculation.

8: Exponential. A lot of calculations.

9: Constant. one calculation.

10: Constant.

11: Linear.
